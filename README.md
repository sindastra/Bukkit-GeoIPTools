# Sindastra's Legacy GeoIPTools
### Geo-IP library for Bukkit and Spigot.
- Supports the GeoIPCountry, GeoIPCity and GeoIPv6 databases by MaxMind <http://www.maxmind.com>.
- Databases are downloaded and updated automatically.
- Auto update can be disabled or delayed (in days).
- Databases are only loaded when a plugin requests it.
- The user can specify from what URL the databases will be downloaded.
- The user can specify a path to their own database files (download and auto-update feature will be disabled in this case).
- Permissions support.
- No more tracking or statistics uploading!

#### MaxMind Info
MaxMind reserves the right to limit the number of downloads made within a limited period of time.

The MaxMind GeoLite Legacy databases are being discontinued by January 2, 2019. 
More information can be found here: https://support.maxmind.com/geolite-legacy-discontinuation-notice/

This project needs to be updated before 2nd of January 2019 to continue working.

This project is not affiliated with MaxMind in any way; I simply use the MaxMind library.
